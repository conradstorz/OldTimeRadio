# OldTimeRadio
A Python powered Raspberry Pi implemented project to play recordings of old radio shows, commercials and news.

The goal is to create a computer that boots directly to an audio player that can be installed into an
old radio cabinet. My preference is to have the audio to be played match the era that the original radio
was constructed in. I have several old radio cabinets that were built during the 1940s. This is an incredibly
interesting time for me. The last world war was underway, radio shows were the TV of the time, radio was loaded
with creative content.

This project will be able to access any time period or all time periods depending...



Some (maybe not all) requirements:

sudo apt-get install espeak python-espeak

sudo apt-get install python-pygame
